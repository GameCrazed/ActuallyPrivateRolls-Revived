# ActuallyPrivateRolls-Revived
> A revived implementation of syl3r86's Actually-Private-Rolls Foundry VTT module.

Hides Private GM Rolls completely rather then just obfuscating the result. This can be toggled on or off in the Settings Menu.

## Installation
1. Copy this link and use it in Foundrys Module Manager to install the Module

    > https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GameCrazed/ActuallyPrivateRolls-Revived/master/module.json
    
2. Enable the Module in your Worlds Module Settings

## Contribution
This is but a humble branch of the original creators work, I'm far from an expert on Javascript so any and all who believe they can fix or improve this module are more than welcome to throw a PR together. Since I use this module in my own Foundry games I'll be keeping it updated where needed.
